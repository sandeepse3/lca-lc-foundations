# # 2.4 Wedding Planner
# In this lab you will build a multi-agent wedding planner.
#
# > Note: This lab has been updated since filming to make the agent performance more robust to errors and to limit run time. In particular: 1) added error handling for MCP failures, 2) limited the number of searches. It's worth noting that, where possible, tool errors should be returned to the agent rather than failing so that the agent can adjust its invocation and try again.
